# simple_hello_world

trying to find out how to flutter... :)

## Getting Started
add docs,   
what how, why?

## points
- vm should be created outside and just be passed on to the screen
- vm should not know about MyScaffoldValue, concrete things/widgets in/on the screen.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;screen should transform if required for particular widgets
